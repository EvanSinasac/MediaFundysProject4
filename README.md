Program runs on Visual Studio Community 2019 in both Debug and Release mode in 64 bit.
DO NOT run in 32 bit.

TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
1. Using Visual Studio Community 2019 in either Debug or Release in 64 bit mode.

TO CHANGE THE AUDIO FILES:
0. For this project, we are using internet sounds instead of audio files
1. From the solution level, navigate through common->assets->audio
2. Change the urls located in internetURLs.txt to change what is played by the program (3)

TO OPERATE THE PROGRAM:
1. This is a simple audio board program that is streaming sounds from the internet, and has controls to modify certain values of them
2. Pressing TAB will pause/unpause the currently playing channel group
3. Pressing 1/2/3 will change which channel group (and in turn which internet sound) is being played.  This also pauses the other channels and un pauses the current channel (so only one sound is played at a time)
4. Pressing O/P will enable/disable the bypass for the first and second DSP on the channel group
5. Pressing Q/W will raise/lower the values of the first DSP on the current channel group
6. Pressing E/R will raise/lower the values of the second DSP on the current channel group
